# Build Yourself a Hasura

Hasura uses GraphQL AST to SQL compilation to generate efficient database queries to return deeply nested data across all database tables, without having to write resolvers for each.

This project shows the techniques used for performance in the Hasura engine.

- [x] Query any table in the postgres database
